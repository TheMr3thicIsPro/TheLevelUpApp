- **Or use Incognito/Private browsing mode**

### 3. Test All Features Again
Repeat the same checklist above on your deployed GitHub Pages site.

## 🚨 If Features Don't Work on GitHub Pages

### Common Issues:

1. **Wrong Files Uploaded**
   - ❌ Uploaded entire project folder
   - ✅ Should only upload contents of `build` folder

2. **Browser Cache**
   - ❌ Old cached files loading
   - ✅ Clear cache completely or use incognito mode

3. **GitHub Pages Not Configured**
   - ❌ Pages not enabled in repository settings
   - ✅ Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main → / (root)

4. **JavaScript Errors**
   - ❌ Console shows errors (F12 → Console)
   - ✅ Check that all files uploaded correctly

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
   - Look for red error messages
   - Check if JavaScript files are loading (200 status)

2. **Verify File Structure** in GitHub repository:
   ```
   ✅ Correct structure:
   your-repo/
   ├── index.html
   ├── 404.html
   ├── _redirects
   └── static/js/main.xxxxx.js
   
   ❌ Wrong structure:
   your-repo/
   ├── src/
   ├── public/
   ├── package.json
   └── ...
   ```

3. **Force Refresh**
   - Windows: Ctrl + F5
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

4. **Test in Different Browser**
   - Try Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Use incognito/private mode

## ✅ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All authentication features work
- [ ] Password toggle buttons function
- [ ] Dev mode activates with "DADFROMDAYDOT"
- [ ] Achievements appear and track progress
- [ ] Mobile layout is responsive
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools
- [ ] Site works in multiple browsers

**Remember**: If it works locally but not on GitHub Pages, it's almost always a deployment configuration issue, not a code problem. The features are all implemented correctly in the build files.
