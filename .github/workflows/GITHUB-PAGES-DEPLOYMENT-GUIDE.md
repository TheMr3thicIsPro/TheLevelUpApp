# 🚀 LevelUp - Complete GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Follow These Steps Exactly

### Step 1: Repository Setup
1. **Create a NEW public GitHub repository**
2. **Name it anything you want** (e.g., `levelup-app`)
3. **DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license**

### Step 2: File Upload
1. **Extract `LevelUp-GitHub-Pages-FIXED.zip`**
2. **Upload ALL files** to the repository root:
   - ✅ `index.html` (main entry point)
   - ✅ `404.html` (handles routing)
   - ✅ `asset-manifest.json`
   - ✅ `static/` folder (contains all JS/CSS)
   - ✅ `GITHUB-PAGES-SETUP.md`

### Step 3: GitHub Pages Configuration
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Choose **"main"** branch
4. Choose **"/ (root)"** folder
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Wait and Access
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** for deployment
- Your app will be at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Site not found" or "404 Page not found"
**Cause**: Files not uploaded correctly or GitHub Pages not enabled
**Solution**:
1. Verify ALL files are in repository root (not in a subfolder)
2. Check GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages
3. Wait 10 minutes and try again
4. Try accessing in incognito/private mode

### "The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file"
**Cause**: Missing index.html or incorrect file structure
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `index.html` is in the repository ROOT directory
2. Check file names are exactly: `index.html` (lowercase)
3. Verify the `static/` folder exists with JS files inside

### App loads but shows blank page
**Cause**: JavaScript files not loading
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify `static/js/` folder contains the main JS file
3. Clear browser cache and reload

**If you're still getting errors, the issue is likely with the file upload process. Make sure ALL files from the zip are in your repository root directory.**
