# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Why Features Disappear on GitHub Pages

If features work locally but disappear when deployed to GitHub Pages, it's usually due to one of these issues:

1. **Incorrect deployment method** - Using source files instead of build files
2. **Missing GitHub Pages configuration** - Not setting up the repository correctly
3. **Browser caching** - Old cached files preventing new features from loading
4. **Path issues** - Incorrect base URL configuration

## ✅ CORRECT Deployment Process

### Step 1: Extract the Build Files
1. Extract `LevelUp-ALL-FEATURES-COMPLETE.zip`
2. **ONLY upload the contents of the `build` folder** to your GitHub repository
3. **DO NOT upload the entire project** - only the build folder contents

### Step 2: Repository Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or use existing)
2. Upload these files from the `build` folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `404.html`
   - `_redirects`
   - `asset-manifest.json`
   - `static/` folder (with all contents)

### Step 3: GitHub Pages Configuration
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select branch: `main` (or `master`)
4. Select folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click Save

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache
1. After deployment, **clear your browser cache completely**
2. Or use incognito/private browsing mode
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Features Still Don't Work:

1. **Check the browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check if files are loading correctly

2. **Verify file structure** in your GitHub repository:
   ```
   your-repo/
   ├── index.html
   ├── 404.html
   ├── _redirects
   ├── asset-manifest.json
   └── static/
       └── js/
           ├── main.c57fd050.js
           ├── main.c57fd050.js.LICENSE.txt
           └── main.c57fd050.js.map
   ```

3. **Force refresh** the page:
   - Windows: Ctrl + F5
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

4. **Check GitHub Pages URL**:
   - Should be: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`
   - Make sure you're accessing the correct URL

## 🎯 Feature Verification Checklist

Once deployed, verify these features work:

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **DON'T upload the entire project folder** - only upload build folder contents
2. **DON'T forget to clear browser cache** after deployment
3. **DON'T use the development server files** - always use the build files
4. **DON'T skip the GitHub Pages configuration** in repository settings

## 📞 If Problems Persist

If features still don't work after following these steps:

1. Check that you uploaded the correct files (from build folder)
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled and configured correctly
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Try accessing the site from a different browser or device
5. Check browser console for any error messages

**Remember**: The build files contain all the compiled and optimized code with all features included. The source files (src folder) are only for development and won't work directly on GitHub Pages.
